===================

Python recursive x86 disassembler - planned to develop into fully functional disassembler, with many features of IDA but with better call graph navigation / walking

This prog uses distorm only

DO NOT USE libdasm although version here has some patches: libdasm library with some patches to fix bugs - don't use upstream version - use this one.
